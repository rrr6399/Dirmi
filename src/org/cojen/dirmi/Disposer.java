/**
 * Identify a method as being a disposer of the enclosing remote object. With
 * such a method, a remote object can be freed before the local garbage
 * collector determines that it is unreachable.
 *
 * <p>When a disposer method is called, it immediately prevents all new remote
 * method inovcations on the same object from functioning. Any attempt causes a
 * {@link NoSuchObjectException} to be thrown. The actual disposer call is
 * allowed to complete normally, but any other methods running concurrently
 * might fail. Exported remote objects on the server side are not actually
 * unreferenced until the disposer implementation completes. Use the {@link
 * Ordered} annotation to ensure that the disposer doesn't run too soon.
