/**
 * Remote method invocation session. Basic communication between sessions is
 * provided by the {@link #send send} and {@link #receive receive} methods,
 * which behave like a blocking queue with a capacity of one. Object transport
 * via this interface is intended for handshaking and authentication. After an
 * initial exchange, remote objects should be used for most communication
 * between endpoints.
 *
 * <p>The send/receive methods follow the pull model rather than the push
 * model. Calling {@code send} locally enqueues an object, but {@code receive}
 * makes a remote call. This behavior allows a {@link #setClassResolver
 * ClassResolver} to be installed prior to its first use, avoiding race
 * conditions.
