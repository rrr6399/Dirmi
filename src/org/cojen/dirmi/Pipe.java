/**
 * A pipe is a bidirectional stream which can be established via an {@link
 * Asynchronous asynchronous} remote method. Pipes can remain open as long as
 * the session is open, and all pipes are closed when the session is
 * closed. Here's an example remote method declaration which uses a pipe:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <b>&#64;Asynchronous</b>
 * <b>Pipe</b> uploadFile(String name, <b>Pipe</b> pipe) throws RemoteException;
 * </pre>
 *
 * The remote method declaration requires the return type to be a pipe and one
 * parameter must also be a pipe. The client-side invocation of the remote
 * method simply passes null for the pipe parameter, and the server-side
 * implementation returns null instead of a pipe. Example client call:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Pipe pipe = server.uploadFile("notes.txt", null);
 *     byte[] notes = ...
 *     pipe.writeInt(notes.length);
 *     pipe.write(notes);
 *     pipe.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * The remote method implementation might look like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public Pipe uploadFile(String name, Pipe pipe) {
 *     byte[] notes = new byte[pipe.readInt()];
 *     pipe.readFully(notes);
 *     pipe.close();
 *     ...
 *     return null;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Pipes are an extension of the remote method invocation itself, which is why
 * only one pipe can be established per call. Any arguments which were passed
 * along with the pipe are written to the same underlying object stream. For
 * long-lived pipes, be sure to call {@link #reset reset} occasionally to allow
 * any previously written objects to be freed.
 *
 * <p>If the pipe is used to pass additional method arguments, consider
 * declaring the method with the {@link CallMode#EVENTUAL eventual} calling
 * mode. By calling {@link #flush flush} after all arguments are written, the
 * number of transported packets is reduced. For the above example, the remote
 * method can be declared as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <b>&#64;Asynchronous(CallMode.EVENTUAL)</b>
 * Pipe uploadFile(String name, Pipe pipe) throws RemoteException;
 * </pre>
 *
 * The example client call doesn't need to do anything different, since closing
 * the pipe implicitly flushes it. If the server is required to return a value
 * over the pipe, then the client call might be written as:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Pipe pipe = server.uploadFile("notes.txt", null);
 *     byte[] notes = ...
 *     pipe.writeInt(notes.length);
 *     pipe.write(notes);
 *     // Flush to ensure arguments and file are transported.
 *     pipe.flush();
 *     // Read server response.
 *     Object response = pipe.readObject();
 *     pipe.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Methods which use pipes may also utilize {@link Timeout timeout}
 * annotations. A timeout task is started when the remote method is invoked,
 * and it must be explicitly {@link #cancelTimeout cancelled} upon receiving
 * the pipe. Timeout tasks may also be explicitly {@link #startTimeout started}
 * without requiring the annotation.
 *
 * <p>Because pipes are bidirectional, extra communication overhead is required
 * to support safe connection recycling. The {@link CallMode#REQUEST_REPLY
 * request/reply} call mode requires less overhead, and is more suitable for
 * short-lived pipes. A request/reply pipe starts in "request" mode, and then
 * it switches to "reply" mode. Initially, the client can write to the pipe,
 * and the server can read from the pipe. As soon as the client performs a
 * read, it automatically flushes the pipe and then it can only perform further
 * reads. Attempting to write again causes an {@code IOException} to be thrown.
 * Likewise, as soon as the server performs a write, it cannot read again. As
 * with normal pipes, both endpoints must close the pipe in order for the
 * connection resource to be fully recycled.
 *
 * <p>Request/reply pipes cannot be efficiently closed by the remote server until the pipe
 * is in reply mode. Closing the pipe prematurely requires that all request input be
 * automatically drained. If the request is of an unbounded size, then the server has no
 * means to effectively abort it. Normal pipes should be used for this case instead.
