/**
 * Identify a method as being asynchronous, which does not imply
 * non-blocking. It merely means that the caller does not wait for the remote
 * method to finish. An asynchronous method will likely block if the transport
 * layer is backed up.
 *
 * <p>An asynchronous method must declare returning {@code void}, {@link Pipe},
 * {@link Completion} or {@link Future}. An asynchronous task represented by a
 * {@code Completion} or {@code Future} cannot be cancelled, at least not
 * directly.  Implementations of asynchronous future methods should return a
 * factory generated {@link Response response}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <b>&#64;Asynchronous</b>
 * void sendMessage(String data) throws RemoteException;
 *
 * <b>&#64;Asynchronous</b>
 * &#64;RemoteFailure(exception=FileNotFoundException.class)
 * Pipe readFile(String name, Pipe pipe) throws FileNotFoundException;
 *
 * <b>&#64;Asynchronous</b>
 * Future&lt;Image&gt; generateImage(int width, int height, Object data) throws RemoteException;
 *
 * <b>&#64;Asynchronous(CallMode.ACKNOWLEDGED)</b>
 * void launchBuild(Object params, ProgressCallback callback) throws RemoteException;
 * </pre>
 *
 * Asynchronous methods can only declare throwing {@link RemoteException} or
 * the exception indicated by {@link RemoteFailure}. A client can expect an
 * exception to be thrown by an asynchronous method only if there is a
 * communication failure. Any exception thrown by the server implementation of
 * an asynchronous {@code void} or {@link Pipe} method is not passed to the
 * client. Instead, it is passed to the thread's uncaught exception handler.
 *
 * <p>For asynchronous methods which return a {@link Completion} or {@link
 * Future}, any server thrown exception is passed to the caller via the
 * returned object. Upon calling {@link Future#get get}, an {@link
 * ExecutionException} is thrown. A communication failure while sending the
 * request is thrown directly to the caller and not through the {@code Future}.
