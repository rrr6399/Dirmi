 * Method annotation which indicates that it can be traced. In order to enable tracing,
 * the {@link org.cojen.dirmi.trace.TraceAgent TraceAgent} must be installed. Method
 * tracing is not limited to remote methods. Any method can be traced, even if no remote
 * features of Dirmi are being used.
 *
 * <p>When using this annotation on remote interfaces, tracing is applied only to
 * client-side invocations. For server-side tracing, the implementing class must provide
 * its own trace annotations.
 *
 * <p>Because method tracing increases execution overhead, use the feature
 * judiciously. Ideal candidates are those which perform complex calculations or depend on
 * external resources.
