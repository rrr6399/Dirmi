/**
 * Remote method timeout policy annotation, which can target a remote interface
 * or method. When annotated at the interface level, it defines default timeout
 * values for all methods. Any method can override the defaults with its own
 * annotation. The timeout annotation can be used with {@link TimeoutUnit} to
 * define the unit. If not specified, it defaults to milliseconds.
 *
 * <p>Timeouts only apply to the caller of a remote method. If the timeout has
 * elapsed without a response from the remote endpoint, the connection is
 * forcibly closed and a {@link RemoteTimeoutException} is thrown. When this
 * happens, no special action is automatically applied on the remote side to
 * interrupt any work in progress. The actual method implementation is
 * responsible for this. If it completes its work and returns after a timeout,
 * the response is discarded.
 *
 * <p>When a {@link RemoteTimeoutException} is thrown, it does not indicate
 * whether the remote endpoint actually received the request or not. Care must
 * be taken when attempting to retry a failed remote invocation, especially if
 * not idempotent. {@link Asynchronous} methods with callbacks can provide more
 * information regarding successful invocation, but timeouts on asynchronous
 * methods alone offer less utility. This is because the timeout on an
 * asynchronous method only applies to the sending of the request. It does not
 * wait for method completion. When using the {@link CallMode#ACKNOWLEDGED
 * acknowledged} calling mode, timeouts do at least wait for acknowledgement.
 * Consider returning a {@link Future} and call the {@code get} method which
 * accepts a timeout.
 *
 * <p>Method parameters may use the {@link TimeoutParam} annotation to specify
 * timeout values and units. When applied to a primitive numeric type (which
 * can be boxed), it specifies the timeout value. At most one parameter can be
 * a timeout value. When the annotation is applied to a parameter of type
 * {@link TimeUnit}, it specifies the timeout unit. Likewise, at most one
 * parameter can be a timeout unit. If no parameter is annotated as a timeout
 * unit but the parameter immediately following the timeout value is a {@code
 * TimeUnit}, it is automatically chosen as the timeout unit parameter.
 *
 * <p>Remote method implementations may make use of timeout parameters to
 * interrupt any work in progress, under the assumption that the caller has
 * given up after the timeout has elapsed.
 *
 * <p>Timeout parameters can have runtime values of null, in which case default
 * timeouts apply. These defaults are defined by any method and interface level
 * timeout annotations. If none, then the default timeout value is infinite and
 * the unit is milliseconds. In either case, the remote endpoint sees the
 * applied values instead of null. If the timeout value cannot be cast to the
 * parameter type without loss of magnitude, -1 (infinite) is passed instead.
