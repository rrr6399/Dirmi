/**
 * Identify a method as being batched and asynchronous, which does not imply
 * non-blocking. Requests are sent to the remote endpoint, but the channel is
 * not immediately flushed. The current thread holds the same channel for
 * making additional requests until an immediate or synchronous request is
 * sent. All requests received by the remote endpoint are executed in one
 * thread, in the correct order. If the sender thread exits before releasing
 * the channel, the batched requests are eventually sent.
 *
 * <p>A batched method must declare returning {@code void}, a {@link Remote}
 * object, {@link Completion} or {@link Future}. Returning a {@code Remote}
 * object allows batched calls to be chained together. A batched task
 * represented by a {@code Completion} or {@code Future} cannot be cancelled,
 * at least not directly. Implementations of batched future methods should
 * return a factory generated {@link Response response}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <b>&#64;Batched</b>
 * void setOption(int option) throws RemoteException;
 *
 * <b>&#64;Batched</b>
 * RemoteAccess login(String user, String password) throws RemoteException, AuthFailure;
 * </pre>
 *
 * Batched methods can declare throwing any exception, and any exception thrown
 * by the server aborts the batch operation. This exception is passed to the
 * caller of the immediate or synchronous method that terminated the batch. If
 * the terminating method does not declare throwing the exception type, it is
 * wrapped by {@link UndeclaredThrowableException}. Any {@code Remote} objects
 * returned from batched methods at or after the exception being thrown will be
 * bogus. Attempts to invoke methods on these objects will also throw the
 * original exception, possibly wrapped.
 *
 * <p>Any exception thrown by a batched method which returns a {@link
 * Completion} or {@link Future} is passed to the caller via the returned
 * object. Upon calling {@link Future#get get}, an {@link ExecutionException}
 * is thrown. A communication failure while sending the request is thrown
 * directly to the caller and not through the {@code Future}.
